##Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I developed was a mobile weight tracking app.  The requirements that this app was to fulfill was an app that would allow a user to log in, or register if they hadn't logged in before.  Once logged in they should be able to enter daily weight in data, and once their weight reaches the weight goal that the user entered into their profile the app will send them a congratulatory SMS.


##What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens required was a login screen, a registration screen, a main screen, and a settings screen.  The login and register screen are similar to most other login and registration screens.  The settings screen currently has the setting to request permission for SMS access.  The main screen displays all the weigh in data for the currently logged in user, with the ability to modify and delete individual weigh ins.
    
    
##How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

My approach to application development involves taking the requirements, and continually breaking it down and expanding upon them until I have a collection of simple requirements that can easily be coded.  This approach already has served me really well in both school and work.


##How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

For this project my testing approach heavily leaned on the Android Emulator.  Running the app in the emulator and testing all functions.


##Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

During this project, the primary challenges mainly involved Android widgets that I was unfamiliar with.  Overcomming those challenges involved using the documentation, and wasn't very complicated to overcome.


##In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe the better part of this app that showed skill was the main screen.  This screen involved a RecyclerView widget, with a CardView to populate the RecyclerView.
